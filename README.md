# Unsupervised Learning
    Narasimha Lakamsani - nlakamsani3@gatech.edu
This project implements three different reinforcement algorithms: value iteration, policy iteration, and Q-learning. These algorithms are used to solve and analyze two different Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

### Problems
* Problem#1: Frozen Lake 
* Problem#2: Blackjack

### Run Code Instuctions
* open collab notebook with learners for Problem#1: https://colab.research.google.com/github/naralakamsani/reinforcment_learning/blob/main/frozen_lake.ipynb
* open collab notebook with learners for Problem#2: https://colab.research.google.com/github/naralakamsani/reinforcment_learning/blob/main/blackjack.ipynb
* Click on the runtime option above. Then proceed to click "run all" to run the entire notebook
* note: It might take a while to finish running the whole notebook, so it might be ideal to run only a few desired focused cells
